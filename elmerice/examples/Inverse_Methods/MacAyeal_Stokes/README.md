# Stokes inverse methods test cases

Optimisation of the basal friction coefficient.

- RUN_TWIN_CONT.sh: 
	- Run a perfect twin experiment with no noise in the input data
	- use the continuous cost function 

- RUN_TWIN_DISC.sh:
	- twin experiment using the discrete cost function
	- Be carefull the data file in DATA has been generated with the SSA Solver so the cost will not converge to 0.
