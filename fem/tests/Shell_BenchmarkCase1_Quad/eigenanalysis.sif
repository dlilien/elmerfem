! Solve eigenvalues of linear shell equations of Reissner-Naghdi type in the case 
! of a cylindrical benchmark problem with membrane-dominated asymptotic behaviour 
! in the linear regime. The linearized problem has been described in 
! Pitk√§ranta et al. Shell deformation states and the finite element method: 
! a benchmark study of cylindrical shells. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics 
! and Engineering 1995. 128:81-121.
